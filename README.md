## üåç Project Idea
Improper waste disposal causes pollution, resource loss, and health issues.  
This project aims to develop an **automated computer vision-based waste classification system** with **three levels of classification**:

1. **Recyclable vs Non-recyclable**  
2. **Type of waste** (paper, plastic, metal, glass, organic, etc.)  
3. **Hazardous waste classification**

The system enhances waste management efficiency, promotes recycling, and ensures safe disposal of hazardous materials.

## üéØ Relevance to SDGs
- **SDG 3 ‚Äì Good Health & Well-being:** Reduces exposure to hazardous waste  
- **SDG 9 ‚Äì Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure:** Promotes sustainable waste management innovation  
- **SDG 11 ‚Äì Sustainable Cities & Communities:** Enables smart municipal waste handling  
- **SDG 12 ‚Äì Responsible Consumption & Production:** Encourages recycling and resource reuse  
- **SDG 13 ‚Äì Climate Action:** Reduces landfill emissions through better waste segregation
